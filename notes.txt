Started a simple linear regressor

# NOTES: I tried rounding the guesses into discrete quantities, and using different regression models. Best R^2 I could get was 0.11 with gradient Boosted regression
# Need to remove collinearity and clean data more
# Need to try other models and maybe look at images
# Try to get an R^2 of at least 0.3 if you can. 
# Look into this https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/87733

I split up the models into classifiers and regressors and ran them

The best performing linear model was the ensemble gradientBoosted Regressor, so I took that to a separate file









First I tried different classification / regression models
I found classification models to be overall much better

Secondly I picked the best regressor model I could find and started to test it with different depths and learning rates
