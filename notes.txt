Started a simple linear regressor

Early notes
I tried rounding the guesses into discrete quantities, and using different regression models. Best R^2 I could get was 0.11 with gradient Boosted regression
Need to remove collinearity and clean data more
Need to try other models and maybe look at images
Try to get an R^2 of at least 0.3 if you can. 
Look into this https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/87733





First I ran different classification / regression models
I found classification models to be overall much better, however I wasn't sure if I should focus on them or not so I tried to improve the score of my best linear regression
I picked the best regressor model I could find and started to test it with different collinearity adjusted datasets and depths and learning rates
I also plotted how it improved compared to the number of estimators used, I am going to next use the best results from all my above testing to provide an optimal algorithm


I expect that getting an accuracy of 0.45 or so is as good as we are going to get without incorporating photos and metadata

NOTES FOR TEAM MEETINGS
- Am I meant to be doing certain classifiers too
- How much can I borrow from other peoples gits
- Lets start to talk about how we want to weave this together into a continous story
